# GPT Voice Mode

An extension to enable voice mode in the ChatGPT browser version. It allows users to interact with ChatGPT using voice commands, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Use commands like "Send", "Speak", "Listen", "Nevermind", and "Stop" to control ChatGPT.
- **Auto Modes**: Automatically activate sending, speaking, or listening modes based on user preferences.
- **VSCode Extension**: Uses a real-time backend (`BrightBaseRealtime`) to synchronize actions from my [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/brightsidedeveloper/chrome-gpt-fire) that sends file contents to this extension.
- **User Interface**: A clean and intuitive popup interface with theme toggles and settings.
